        With a background in nursing and health service management, I am a
        driven healthcare professional currently looking for a position as a
        clinical coordinator at Mark Moran Little Bay. Having worked as a
        nursing assistant for more than a year, I offer solid clinical and
        managerial expertise, a dedication to person-centered care, and an
        emphasis on lifelong learning. My Masterâ€™s in Health Service Management
        enhances my proficiency in quality improvement and regulatory
        compliance, while my multicultural experience in Nepal and Australia
        allows me to offer culturally sensitive care. I am well-equipped to
        assist staff growth and guarantee residents receive high-quality care
        because of my talents in effective communication, teamwork, and empathy.
